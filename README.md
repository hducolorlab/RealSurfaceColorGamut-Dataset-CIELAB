# Real Surface Color Gamut Dataset (CIELAB-based)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This dataset contains 102,801 reflectance samples constituting the gamut of real surface colors under D65 illuminant in CIELAB color space. It serves as a reference for:

- Gamut mapping in color reproduction workflows    

- Display device gamut evaluation 
---

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset Composition  
The gamut of real surface colours is constituted of both natural and artificial colours. The category of natural colours includes, but is not limited to, vegetables and grass. The category of artificial colours encompasses textiles, plastics, coatings and others.
